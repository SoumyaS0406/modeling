This was my starting point to Machine Learning. 
Before delving into complex machine learning projects, I started playing with below research datasets from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. 

### Iris: 

The iris data set contains 3 classes each consists of 50 instances, where each class refers to a category of iris plant. The goal is to classify these iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals. This is viewed as Multi-level classification task.

### Heart Disease:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). 

### Reuters: 

Reuters is a primary dataset for document classification. In particular it is a multi-class, multi-label dataset. It is a text categorization task with  90 classes, 7769 training documents and 3019 testing documents.

### Wine Quality: 

The goal is to predict the quality given the physicochemical attributes of wine. There are 11 input variables and one output variable

### Wisconsin Brest Cancer: 

The data set contains results of routine breast cancer screen, which allows the disease to be diagnosed and treated prior to it causing noticeable symptoms. The goal is to predict whether patient has a benign or malignant tumor. This is viewed as classification task.

### Car Evaluation:

The dataset consists of 1728 instances and each record contains seven attributes which are: buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons to carry, the size of luggage boot, estimated safety of the car, and car acceptability. 
The attribute of car acceptability is a class label which used to classify the degree of the car that customers accept, the other attributes are viewed as predictive variables.
